# Modular Component Showcase Application

## Description
A single-page application (SPA) designed to demonstrate reusable UI components, their interactions, and behavior under different configurations. The focus is on component modularity, controlled state variations, prop-driven rendering, routing, and performance optimization.

## Key Architecture Goals
- Modular component library with reusable and configurable UI elements
- Controlled state and props to manage dynamic behavior
- Route-based organization of component categories or demos
- Asynchronous simulation of interactions or dynamic data updates
- Performance optimization for multiple interactive components
- Conditional rendering to demonstrate different component states
- Accessibility-ready components with keyboard and focus handling

## Major Features
- Library of reusable UI components (buttons, cards, tables, charts)
- Interactive demos showcasing controlled state and prop variations
- Route-based navigation across component categories
- Async simulation of interactions or data feeding
- Conditional rendering for different component states and variants
- Performance-optimized rendering for multiple interactive demos
- Accessible demos with focus management and keyboard support
